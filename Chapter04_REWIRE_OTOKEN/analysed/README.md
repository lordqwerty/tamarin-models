TAMARIN Models from Chapter 4
=============================

This is the README for the Tamarin files associated with my thesis
Chapter 4. Additionally, we have stored the proved models in the `analysed`
folder.

Running Tamarin on the models
-----------------------------

To load the proved models from within this folder load the models in the GUI mode:
```bash
$ tamarin-prover interactive .
```
and then point your browser to [http://localhost:3001/](http://localhost:3001/).
