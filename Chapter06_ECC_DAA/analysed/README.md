TAMARIN from Chapter 6 ECC DAA
==============================

This is the README for the Tamarin files associated with my
thesis in chapter 6. This folder contains the proved theories.

Please see the sub-directory `observatonalEquiv`
for the partial and proved model with the `diff` terms which performs
the observational equivalence analysis.

Running Tamarin on the models
-----------------------------

To load the proved models from within this folder load the models in the GUI mode:
```bash
$ tamarin-prover interactive .
```
and then point your browser to [http://localhost:3001/](http://localhost:3001/).

* To load the observational equivalence model see the README in the `observationalEquiv` folder.
